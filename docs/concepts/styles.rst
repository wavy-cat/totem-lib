Styles
======

Styles are classes that inherit from and implement the `AbstractStyle` abstract class.
In simple terms, they offer the `.image()` method for generating the totem texture.
To use a style, simply pass it (not its instance) to the builder's `style` parameter.

You can also create your own styles simply by creating classes that inherit from `AbstractStyle`.
